   If you're wondering what happens when a bunch of nerds are packed into an apartment...
   
   The result is a hard mathematics challenge, but if you're the only one to solve, that's a lot of points$$$$.
   
   All description is in the pdf, which also contains the description of the second challenge, since they share common context.
   Context is shared, but flags are independent, so you don't need one before trying the other.
